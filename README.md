# 🌾 Precision Farming - ML-Based Crop Recommender

## Overview

**Precision Farming** is a machine learning-based system designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders make smarter decisions about crop selection based on key environmental and soil parameters. This project aims to boost agricultural productivity, sustainability, and profitability using data-driven recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Crop Recommendation** based on:
  - Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
  - Rainfall
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
- 🧠 Trained using multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
- 📊 Clean and structured data preprocessing pipeline
- 🌐 Web interface using Flask/Streamlit (optional)
- 📁 Easy to extend with custom datasets or sensors (e.g., IoT devices)

## 🧪 Machine Learning

The recommender system was trained on a dataset containing agronomic data from various regions. After cleaning and preprocessing, multiple ML models were evaluated, with **Random Forest** showing the best performance.

### Model Performance

| Model         | Accuracy |
|---------------|----------|
| Random Forest | 98%      |
| SVM           | 94%      |
| KNN           | 91%      |
| Decision Tree | 92%      |
